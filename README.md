# WBC-Biomarker-ID-for-FASD-GDM-
Identifying potential biomarkers for FASD and GBM among alternative splicing events in WBCs using LSTM.

**LSTM Prediction Problem type:** Many to One Sequence Classification problem. Given an input sequence, remember and predict the integer at a specific input location.

**To reduce stochasticity:**
  Output was made consistent by fixing the NumPy random number seed to 007.
  Model was evaluated multiple times and the average of the final score was taken.
